# About

`lpa` provides a mechanism for analyzing the contents of Linux packages.

`lpa` works by importing a source of Linux packages (e.g. a Debian or RPM
repository) and storing the indexed result in a local SQLite database. The
SQLite database can then be queried by `lpa` (or your own code if desired)
to answer questions about content therein.
